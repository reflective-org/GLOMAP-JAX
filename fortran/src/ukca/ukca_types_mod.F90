! (at UM vn12.2)

! Range for 32 bit integer
INTEGER, PARAMETER :: irange32 = 9
! Kind for 32 bit integer
INTEGER, PARAMETER, PUBLIC :: integer_32 = SELECTED_INT_KIND(irange32)
! Range for small logicals
INTEGER, PARAMETER :: lrange1=1
! Kind for 32 bit logicals. Note that there is no
! "selected_logical_kind", but using the equivalent integer kind is a
! workaround that works on every platform tested.
INTEGER, PARAMETER, PUBLIC :: logical_32 = integer_32
! Kind for small logicals
INTEGER, PARAMETER, PUBLIC :: log_small = SELECTED_INT_KIND(lrange1)
