!
!     Subroutine to calculate impaction scavenging of aerosols
!     by falling raindrops and snow.
!
!     Uses empirical expression for the terminal velocity of raindrops
!     of Easter & Hales (1984)
!
!     Uses look-up table of aerosol-raindrop collision efficiencies
!     provided by Yan Yin, University of Aberystwyth. These were
!     originally generated for a specific NROW=19-bin raindrop radius
!     grid colliding with the NCOLL=20-bin aerosol size grid currently
!     used in GLOMAP.
!
!     Currently the routine is only set for a NRBINS=7-bin raindrop
!     size grid consisting of the 4th,6th,8th,10th,12th,14th,16th bin
!     centres of the original 19-bin raindrop size grid. These
!     correspond to raindrop radii of 4.0, 10.08, 25.4, 64.0, 161.3,
!     406.4 and 1024.0 microns and a geometric scaling factor of 2.52.
!
!     The raindrop radii and corresponding aerosol collision
!     efficiencies have already been read in from file and are
!     passed into IMPC_SCAV explicitly as the arrays RADDROP(NROW)
!     and COLLEFF4(NCOLL,NROW)
!
!     Raindrop size distribution assumed is Marshall-Palmer distribution
!     as modified by Sekhon & Srivastava (1971) to take into account
!     rainfall intensity.
!
!     MP have dN/dDp = n_0 * exp (-Psi*Dp) with Psi=4.1*p0^-0.21 mm^-1
!
!       where p0 is precipitation rate (mm/hour)
!             Dp is particle diameter (mm)
!             n_0 is a constant = 8000 drops/m3
!
!     SS modified this to set n_0 to also vary with precipitation rate:
!
!             n_0=7000*p0^0.37 m^-3 mm^-1
!         and Psi= 3.8*p0^-0.14 mm^-1
!
!     Scheme developed using the BCS relation of Slinn 1983, scavenging
!     coeffs supplied by Yan Yin, from Flossmann et al (1985)
!
!     This scheme was developed by Kirsty Pringle as part of PhD thesis.
!
!     The impaction scavenging by snowfall is based on the simple
!     parameterization of Wang et al. (2011)
!                             k = aP^b ,
!     where P is the total snowfall rate and the coefficients a and b
!     are dependent on aerosol size and are taken from Wang et al. (2011)
!     and Feng (2009).

!The bugs in question are:
!1)  Convective fraction (FC) was used in the calculation of removal rate, but
!not in the calculation of rain properties used for the scavenging coefficients.
!2) Scavenging coefficients were calculated using total precip rates,
!(convective plus dynamic) but then subsequently used to calculate removal by
!convective and dynamic precip separately, effectively "double counting".
